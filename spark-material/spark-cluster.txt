To create a cluster we first need to be able to perform password less ssh on all systems so that the machine can communicate with each other. 
In order to do this, the following steps need to be done only on the master machine:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""

This will create a file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub in master. Copy contents of this file to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in all slave machines.

We need to configure the master in order to communicate with all the slaves, do these steps:

1.go to the spark/conf folder
2.run this command `cp spark-env.sh.template spark-env.sh`
3.open spark-env.sh and add the following lines
    a.export SPARK_LOCAL_IP=<enter Master machine IP>           
    b.export SPARK_MASTER_HOST=<enter Master machine IP>

On master machine, create a new file called slaves in spark/conf folder and enter the following lines. Enter all slave machine IPs
    <enter Master machine hostname(eg F4Linux1)>  
    <enter slave machine hostname (egF4Linux2> 

All the setup has been done, to start the cluster run the spark/sbin/start-all.sh executable on master machine

Check the cluster is running properly by using the browser and going to the following url http://<master-ip>:8080 and checking if all master and slave urls are present
